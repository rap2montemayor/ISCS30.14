# ISCS30.14

Some select projects I did for a game dev class during college. I opted to write everything entirely in C++ with SFML as the only third party library I used.

I initially did not intend to keep these around, but it might be interesting for others to see how a 3rd year college student figured out how to build some of the things here.
