# ISCS30.14

Some select projects I did for a game dev class (ISCS 30.14) during college. I opted to write everything entirely in C++ with SFML as the only third party library I used. On top of SFML, I built another framework for handling low level systems such as an event system, resource management, and a barebones entity-component-system. This was built over the course of 2 months. I decided to call this framework `poly engine`. I enlisted in ISCS 30.14 the following semester and tried to do everything only using SFML, poly engine and the C++ standard library.

I initially did not intend to keep these around, but it might be interesting for others to see how a 3rd year college student figured out how to build some of the things here. For reference, the projects required for that class were the following:

- Output 1 - Turn based RPG menu (not included)
- Output 2 - Tile based movement
- Output 3 - Platformer
- Output 4 - Shoot 'em up
- Ouptut 5 - Third person shooter (not included, built with Unity)
